META-INF
services:

Java’s standard Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism.

At compile time, Error Prone does:
ServiceLoader.load(BugChecker.class)

Which causes the JVM to look for:
META-INF/services/<interface FQN>

So the lookup path must match exactly:
META-INF/services/com.google.errorprone.bugpatterns.BugChecker

---------------------
the core idea is create a child module which 'hooks' into the compiler process
^ need to understand how that works exactly

seems to just need a few dependencies and compilerArgs to enable jdk internal classes to be visible

----------------------------

How Error Prone Checkers Work
The hook happens through several components working together:
1. Maven Compiler Plugin activates Error Prone
2. Error Prone Core is made available
The Fix: Separate Compilation
Option 1: Disable Error Prone for main sources, enable for test sources
This way:

Main compilation builds your checker WITHOUT running Error Prone
Test compilation loads your checker (from target/classes) and runs it on test code
