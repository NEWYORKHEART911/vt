Focus on reducing failed CASs (use cells, or a small semaphore gate) —
because actual contention costs are usually in the CAS and cache-coherence stalls,
not the spin loop itself.

Use Thread.onSpinWait() (as you already do) — it helps on modern CPUs.

Benchmark on your target hardware (JMH) — that will tell you the real numbers you care about.
