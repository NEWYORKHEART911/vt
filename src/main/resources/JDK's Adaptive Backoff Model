1. Start with cheap CAS spins
Good when contention is light.

2. Exponential spin backoff
Reduces CAS collisions.

3. Yield
Relinquishes CPU when your CAS isn’t going to win.

4. Minimal parking
Removes CPU burn under heavy contention.

5. Fallback path
Prevent starvation and ensure eventual progress.
